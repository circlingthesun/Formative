Formative README

PIL workaround
==============
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so /usr/lib/
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib/
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib/


Notes
=====
assumption that forms are black and white, made up of lines, text, and logo

they consist of lines and words
and maybe a logo 23:48:35
so I'm thinking 23:49:00
somehow get rid of all the words 23:49:12
then do line detection 23:49:39
then some how determine what the lines mean 23:50:18
what do they represent
